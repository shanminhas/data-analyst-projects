# Data Analyst Projects

## Now these are just some projects I've done in the realm of data analysis. I have some more in the works but aren't "completed"

## Finished Projects
### Over the Years: Amazon Bestsellers - Top 50 Books (2009-2019)
Within the Google ceritifcate, there was an option to do a non-guided project. Considereding I had already done a guided one, I leaned to this to expand my skills. I chose this book related dataset on Kaggle as I am an avid reader (and a novice writer)!

### Guided Project: User Data from a Bike Rental Service
I decided to use R for this guided project as I had experience with R before for statistics when I was helping my sister with her Masters. This was not my first data project, but the first after making the choice to come into this field.

## Coming Soon
### League of Legends: Winrates of the 2022 Season
I had the idea for this A LONG time ago, even before I was interested in making the career shift to data analytics. I was curious to see if certain champions (champions being the characters players can play in the game) have better winrates on certain sides (a side being the part of the map the team controls). I have made quite a bit of progress on this one, but I want more of a plot to my presentation before I post this.
### Over the Years: Popular Names
This project started when I started writing my book. Character names are always needed and some characters don't really warrant much thought to them. So I thought I'd run some data and find some generic names that I could use to slightly indicate that the character with this name is not important to the story overall (i.e. something along the lines of John Smith or Jane Doe). This one is quite recent and honestly there is not much to the presentation of the results I want. Hence why I have not posted this yet.
